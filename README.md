
https://spoutible.com SOURCE CODE LEAKED.

This repository contains the source code of https://spoutible.com

The 'CEO' of 'https//spoutible.com' - Mr Christopher Bouzy, claims he built this Twitter-Killer from the ground up with a team of seven people (he didn't), and is soliciting thousands of dollars in donations while he slow-rolls out 'new' features many of which are already available in the code. All while pretending he's developing this with his 'team'. 

Conundrum:

Did his staging server at https://st1.spoutible.com (74.208.38.106) get hacked and this repository of the Spoutible source code is the result?

Or

Did we purchase the exact same code Mr Bouzy bought, available to anyone with 89 dollars from a Russian developer on https://CodeCanyon.net, and upload it here for all the world to see - and hopefully check it for vulnerabilities? (There are many.)

Which is it Christopher?

Which lie are you going to go with in order to continue to scam 1000's of dollars from people who don't know about your long history of grifts cons and scams? More about that here https://post.news/@/user/2LEUCBvJSX7mQY3cqj1EmQ8ZSPN

You either have to say you were 'hacked'(again remember this - https://twitter.com/hiitsennui/status/1623248942585479169). Or you have to admit you didn't develop https://spoutible.com yourself and you're scamming lots of people out of lots of cash with lies.

For everyone else:

Clone this repo and follow the install instructions in the 'documentation' folder - you too can be a 'Twitter Killer'. Make sure you change the logo to a whale, but don't steal the logo like Christopher Bouzy did. We're serious - https://twitter.com/sambee89/status/1645247470249689088

We should all ask Christopher here - https://twitter.com/cbouzy

The orignial code and full documentation is also available for purchase here, look at them screenshots!:
